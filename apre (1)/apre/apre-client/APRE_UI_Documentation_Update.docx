Sales by Product and Customer Component

Location: `src/app/reports/sales/sales-by-product-customer/`

Component: `SalesByProductCustomerComponent`

Route:
- `/reports/sales/sales-by-product-customer`

Description:
This component fetches aggregated sales data grouped by product and customer from the API endpoint `/reports/sales/sales-by-product-customer` and displays the results as a bar chart (using `ChartComponent`) or as a paginated/sortable table (using `TableComponent`).

Inputs & Controls:
- Date range selectors (start/end date)
- Product and Customer filter inputs (optional)
- Submit button to refresh data
- Toggle button to switch between chart and table views

Displayed Data:
- product: string
- customer: string
- totalSales: number
- salesCount: number

Implementation notes:
- Uses `HttpClient` to call the API. The component is a standalone component and imports `ChartComponent` and `TableComponent`.
- Tests: `sales-by-product-customer.component.spec.ts` (3 unit tests: creation, API fetch/populate, toggle view)
